Pilo Regular

This type design project was long overdue. In collaboration Kenneth Pilo, Mårten Fischer, Raymond Larabie of Typodermic Fonts Inc., and Göran Söderström, the font “Pilo Regular” was born in 2007. Pilo Regular is a bold, single weight OpenType font featuring subtle inline detailing and a solid sporting aesthetic. It feels both hard and soft, decorative and stoic, vintage and modern. Originally published exclusively by Veer.

Pilo Thin

The mission of Pilo Thin was to create a font that was exactly the opposite of Pilo Regular—a thinner cousin, which would create contrast and become a credible member of the family. Pilo Thin was made in collaboration with Kenneth Pilo, Göran Söderström and Mårten Fischer and was also originally published exclusively by Veer.
